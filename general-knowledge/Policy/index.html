    <div class="pagetitle">Policy</div>

    <div class="subsection">1. What is Policy Debate?</div>

    <div class="section">Definition & Role in Parli</div>
    <div class="text">Policy debate in Parliamentary (Parli) debate differs from traditional Policy debate formats. In Parli, policy often emerges when debaters advocate for or critique specific courses of action. A “policy” refers to a proposed plan of action by a governmental or institutional actor. Policy arguments often appear in “should” resolutions (e.g., “This House would ban private prisons.”)</div>

    <div class="section">Why Policy Matters in Parli</div>
    <div class="text">Policy knowledge helps Government teams build realistic and persuasive plans of action. Opposition teams can use policy analysis to critique feasibility, propose counterplans, or defend the status quo.</div>
    <div class="subsection">2. Core Concepts of Policy Analysis</div>

    <div class="section">2.1 Cost-Benefit Analysis</div>
    <div class="text">Evaluating whether the benefits of a policy outweigh the costs. A common framework for assessing comparative advantage between the plan and alternatives.</div>
    <div class="text">Consider scope (how many affected), magnitude (severity), and probability (likelihood). Quantify impacts when possible: "Plan saves 5,000 lives per year," vs. "Costs $1 billion annually."</div>

    <div class="section">2.2 Feasibility & Implementation</div>
    <div class="text">Key questions: Can the plan be realistically enacted? Consider legal authority (e.g., federal vs. state), resource requirements (funding, labor, infrastructure), and enforcement capacity.</div>

    <div class="section">2.3 Solvency</div>
    <div class="text">How well does the plan address the stated harm? Test whether the mechanism leads to the desired outcome. Common mechanisms: Regulation (bans, mandates), incentives (grants, tax cuts), education (public awareness).</div>

    <div class="section">2.4 Status Quo & Counterfactuals</div>
    <div class="text">Status quo: Existing conditions without the plan. Counterfactual: What would happen instead of the plan.</div>
    <div class="text">Opp can: defend the status quo ("Current policy is improving"), present a counterplan ("Here’s a better way to solve it"), or argue that change creates new harms or instability.</div>

    <div class="subsection">3. Types of Policy Mechanisms</div>

    <div class="section">3.1 Legislation</div>
    <div class="text">Laws passed by parliaments or legislatures (e.g., Clean Air Act, Affordable Care Act). Often requires strong political alignment to pass and is enforced through legal systems.</div>

    <div class="section">3.2 Regulation</div>
    <div class="text">Rules by executive agencies (e.g., EPA, FDA, SEC). Usually more flexible and easier to implement than legislation. Gov can use regulation to avoid legislative gridlock.</div>

    <div class="section">3.3 Incentives & Disincentives</div>
    <div class="text">Incentives: Tax credits, subsidies, grants. Disincentives: Fines, penalties, sin taxes. Common in climate, health, and education policy. Evaluate effectiveness and unintended effects.</div>

    <div class="section">3.4 Public Services & Programs</div>
    <div class="text">Direct provision: Medicare, public schools, infrastructure. Opp teams can argue inefficiency, bureaucracy, or the value of private alternatives.</div>

    <div class="section">3.5 International Policy Tools</div>
    <div class="text">Diplomacy: Treaties, trade deals. Coercion: Sanctions, tariffs, embargoes. Development aid: Financial or logistical support. Key in foreign policy, security, and global health debates.</div>

    <div class="subsection">4. How to Debate Policy Effectively</div>

    <div class="section">4.1 Writing a Solid Plan Text (Gov)</div>
    <div class="text">Include:  
      <ul>
        <li>Agent – Who enacts the plan</li>
        <li>Mandate – What the plan does</li>
        <li>Enforcement – How compliance is ensured</li>
        <li>Funding – How it’s paid for</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">4.2 Testing Policy Proposals (Opp)</div>
    <div class="text">Use disadvantages such as:  
      <ul>
        <li>Economic harms</li>
        <li>Rights violations</li>
        <li>Political backlash</li>
        <li>Geopolitical instability</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="text">Opp teams can offer a counterplan, defend status quo improvements, or argue plan redundancy.</div>

    <div class="section">4.3 Framing and Impact Calculus (Both Sides)</div>
    <div class="text">Prioritize impacts by:
      <ul>
        <li>Time frame – Which impacts happen first?</li>
        <li>Magnitude – Which affect more people or more severely?</li>
        <li>Probability – Which are more likely to occur?</li>
        <li>Reversibility – Which impacts are permanent?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
