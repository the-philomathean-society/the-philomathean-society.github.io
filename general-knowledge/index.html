    <div class="text">Many debate motions require an understanding of common themes such as philosophy, policy, or economics. For example, a controversial and well-known policy like Universal Basic Income (UBI) is frequently mentioned. Understanding basic economic terms such as supply and demand will also improve the quality of your speeches in many rounds.</div>
    <div class="text">While it is unlikely that a motion will make you debate a complex philosophical concept with no explanation whatsoever, philosophy can still serve as a good framework for principle arguments. In This House Would (THW) motions, the idea of liberty and bodily autonomy is often brought up. Social contract is also useful in motions discussing the role of government.</div>
