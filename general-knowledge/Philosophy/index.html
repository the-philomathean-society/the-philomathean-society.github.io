      <div class="subsection">Why use philosophy?</div>
      <div class="text-block">
        In debate, philosophy is a tool that can be implemented into your arguments. Knowledge of philosophical concepts can enhance and support your points, achieving a balance between practical and theoretical argumentation.
      </div>

      <div class="text-block"><strong>Benefits:</strong></div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Improve creativity of arguments:</strong> Creative arguments are often more effective for captivating an audience. The ability to combine reasoning with insightful analogies and comparisons demonstrates good interpretation and delivery skills.</li>
        <li><strong>Improve reasoning and argumentative skills.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Demonstrate viable proof of arguments:</strong> Use concrete philosophical theories and doctrines as evidentiary support for your general reasoning.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhance persuasiveness:</strong> Strong philosophical evidence can approve argumentability and makes reasoning more attractive for the audience.</li>
        <li><strong>Improve external philosophical knowledge and application:</strong> Personal benefit of increased philosophical awareness, a tool that can be utilized in various forms of academia.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="subsection">Common Philosophical Backings Used in Debate</div>

      <div class="text-block"><strong>Epictetus’ Theories of Stoicism Applied to Debate</strong></div>
      <div class="text-block">
        Epictetus was a stoic philosopher that believed in the intrinsic connection between man and God, implying that the will of man was correlated with that of God. In a debating scenario, this theory could be applied to accentuate an argument that may propose the importance/necessity of religion, for directing human action and judgement.
      </div>

      <div class="text-block"><strong>Common Utilitarianism Arguments</strong></div>
      <div class="text-block">
        Utilitarianism argues for the “greater/aggregate good” of a human population. In a debating scenario, this theory could be applied to support an argument related to the mandatory adoption of voting for all citizens, proposing that the enactment of this proposition would support the aggregate good of all parties involved, for promoting unified contributions to government and active involvement in different campaigns.
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">Philosophical Frameworks and Concepts</div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Utilitarianism:</strong> Maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain – attempting to quantify the results of actions and base judgements off of that. Greatest Good for the Greatest Number of People.</li>
        <li><strong>Deontology:</strong> Living by specific rules that we can never break – moral truths. Prioritize Morality of actions over impact.</li>
        <li><strong>Constitutionality:</strong> We should make our decisions based on what the Constitution tells us to do.</li>
        <li><strong>Rule of Law:</strong> This can mean either following laws or doing what upholds the legitimacy of laws.</li>
        <li><strong>Democracy:</strong> The government system which involves voting for leaders. Democratic Values – things needed to make a successful democracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Pluralism:</strong> Free access to information. Citizens who actively participate in civil society.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Contract:</strong> An agreement between a government and its citizens that outlines the roles and obligations of the government.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="text-block"><strong>Social Contract Thinkers</strong></div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>John Locke:</strong> People have inalienable rights to life, liberty, and property. In the state of nature, these rights are endangered. Government protects them; if violated, the people overthrow it.</li>
        <li><strong>Thomas Hobbes:</strong> Humans are inherently greedy and violent. Government is needed to avoid anarchy. The Leviathan is a supreme leader.</li>
        <li><strong>Jean-Jacques Rousseau:</strong> Humans are born free but slave to instincts. By joining society and following the general will, liberty is preserved and rationality is achieved.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sovereignty:</strong> States should be able to act without external interference. Morality is shaped by community.</li>
        <li><strong>Moral Relativism:</strong> Morality varies by culture and situation.</li>
        <li><strong>Liberty/Autonomy:</strong> Maximizing individual freedom to act. Resisting oppression, such as racism or patriarchy, can be a criterion.</li>
        <li><strong>Rawlsian Justice:</strong> Based on John Rawls. Focus on improving conditions of the least well-off. Design society behind the “veil of ignorance.”</li>
        <li><strong>Equality:</strong> Includes egalitarianism (equality under law) and equity (treating people fairly, not equally).</li>
        <li><strong>Structural Violence:</strong> Societal structures exclude people from moral consideration. Ethical theories often overlook out-groups.</li>
        <li><strong>Political Realism:</strong> Countries act in self-interest. No obligation to other states in international anarchy.</li>
        <li><strong>Cosmopolitanism:</strong> All humanity is part of one moral community. Nations and borders are arbitrary.</li>
        <li><strong>Communitarianism:</strong> Morality is rooted in community. Community should be preserved.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtue Ethics:</strong> Fosters good virtues (patience, humility, etc.) and emphasizes becoming a better person.</li>
      </ul>
