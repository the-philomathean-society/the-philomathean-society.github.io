      <div class="text">Economic systems are frequently used for worldbuilding, yet to do so it is critical to understand what they are and how they work.</div>

      <div class="subsection">Capitalism</div>
      <ul class="text">
        <li>Most common (arguably only existing) economic system today</li>
        <li>Means of production → private ownership (factories, land, businesses, etc.)</li>
        <li>Goods and services distributed through voluntary exchange in markets</li>
        <li>Laissez-faire model (minimal government interference)</li>
        <li>Prices determined by supply and demand</li>
        <li>Core of competition → drives innovation, efficiency, and consumer choice</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="subsection">Socialism</div>
      <ul class="text">
        <li>Means of production → majority public/state ownership</li>
        <li>Goal: common welfare and reduced inequality</li>
        <li>Markets still operate, but government plays strong redistributive role</li>
        <li>Viewed as radical yet inefficient</li>
        <li>Obstacles: heavy government interference leads to inefficiency, high taxes, reduced incentives</li>
        <li>Rarely successfully implemented; Scandinavian countries often cited as partial examples</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="subsection">Communism</div>
      <ul class="text">
        <li>Theoretical economic and political system</li>
        <li>Means of production entirely state-owned</li>
        <li>All property is state-owned; class distinctions eliminated</li>
        <li>Goods distributed based on need rather than effort or capital</li>
        <li>In practice often marked by authoritarian control, lack of freedoms, and inefficiency</li>
      </ul>

            <td>"Capitalism leads to fairness”<br><br>Link: Markets are naturally fair, will fall to equilibrium balance between producers and consumers</td>
            <td>Weak. This argument overlooks market failures, externalities, monopolies, and other complicated factors. Markets are logical, and in the ideal world capitalism will mean competing producers will work to obtain as much market share as possible. However, the lower purchasing power of individuals due to income inequality ensures that any equilibrium will inevitably leave some people out.</td>
            <td>Equilibrium balance prioritizes the majority, some people are inevitably left out if they are a small market with low purchasing power.<br>Real world examples of income inequality in capitalist systems (e.g. the U.S.)</td>

          </tr>
            <td>“Socialism solves for poverty + income inequality”<br><br>Link: state redistribution of wealth ensures basic standards of living</td>
            <td>Weak. While some radical judges may buy it, it will not stand up to opponents with an understanding of economics. If your resolution is abstract enough that you can use the Scandinavian model, you may be able to win it, but if it references the U.S., other superpowers, developing nations, or an overgeneralized world, it will not.</td>
            <td>Ignores key tradeoffs that limit effectiveness:<br>
              – Redistribution disincentivizes work or innovation, especially if cost is covered by taxation<br>
              – Easily leads to economic stagnation and government overreach<br>
              – If cost is absorbed by government, national debt will rise to unsustainable levels<br>
              Real world examples: Soviet Union, Maoist China, and Cuba all claimed to be socialist and still struggled with poverty, rationing, and black markets
