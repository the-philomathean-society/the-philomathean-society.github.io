<div class="text">Economic systems are frequently used for worldbuilding, yet to do so it is critical to understand what they are and how they work.</div>


<div class="subsection">Capitalism</div>
<ul class="text">
<li>Most common (arguably only existing) economic system today</li>
<li>Means of production → private ownership (factories, land, businesses, etc.)</li>
<li>Goods and services distributed through voluntary exchange in markets</li>
<li>Laissez-faire model (minimal government interference)</li>
<li>Prices determined by supply and demand</li>
<li>Core of competition → drives innovation, efficiency, and consumer choice</li>
</ul>


<div class="subsection">Socialism</div>
<ul class="text">
<li>Means of production → majority public/state ownership</li>
<li>Goal: common welfare and reduced inequality</li>
<li>Markets still operate, but government plays strong redistributive role</li>
<li>Viewed as radical yet inefficient</li>
<li>Obstacles: heavy government interference leads to inefficiency, high taxes, reduced incentives</li>
<li>Rarely successfully implemented; Scandinavian countries often cited as partial examples</li>
</ul>


<div class="subsection">Communism</div>
<ul class="text">
<li>Theoretical economic and political system</li>
<li>Means of production entirely state-owned</li>
<li>All property is state-owned; class distinctions eliminated</li>
<li>Goods distributed based on need rather than effort or capital</li>
<li>In practice often marked by authoritarian control, lack of freedoms, and inefficiency</li>
</ul>
