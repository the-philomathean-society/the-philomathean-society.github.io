      <div class="pagetitle">Schools of Thought: Keynesian vs. Classical</div>

      <div class="text">Keynesian and classical schools of economic thought are competing perspectives on economic models and how they should deal with certain obstacles.</div>

      <div class="subsection">Classical</div>
      <div class="text">Classical economists fundamentally believe that markets are self-correcting, therefore the role of government should be minimal in order to let the “market take its course.”</div>
      <ul class="text">
        <li>Short run aggregate demand will ultimately settle at equilibrium along long run aggregate supply (LRAS), which has no impact on price levels (vertical line).</li>
        <li>The economy will contract and expand on its own around a constant line of growth.</li>
        <li>Competition is preferred over government interference — the “laissez-faire” or free market.</li>
        <li>Policy focuses on long-term supply changes (e.g. tax cuts) rather than short-run fiscal policy (demand-side).</li>
        <li>Purpose: Avoid negative side effects of demand-side policy (e.g., crowding out private firms and individuals).</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="media">

      </div>

      <div class="subsection">Keynesian View</div>
      <div class="text">Keynesian economists believe that markets can fail in the short run and therefore require active stimulation from the government or central bank in downturns. While acknowledging potential side effects of fiscal or monetary policy, they believe the net effect can be positive.</div>
      <ul class="text">
        <li><strong>Stagflation:</strong> Economic stagnation + inflation. Example: 1970s recession required government action.</li>
        <li><strong>Sticky Wages:</strong> Wages don't adjust quickly due to labor contracts, so government must step in during downturns.</li>
