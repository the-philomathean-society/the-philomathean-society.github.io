      <div class="pagetitle">Fiscal and Monetary Policy</div>
      <div class="text">Fiscal and monetary policy are two primary tools governments and central banks use to manage national economic status. Policies can be divided into two main strategies: <strong>expansionary</strong>, to stimulate demand; and <strong>contractionary</strong>, to control inflation and restore balance.</div>

      <div class="subsection">Fiscal Policy</div>
      <div class="text">Fiscal policy is executed by the government primarily through taxes and government spending.</div>
      <div class="text"><strong>Expansionary:</strong></div>
      <ul class="text">
        <li>Tax cuts</li>
        <li>Stimulus checks</li>
        <li>Infrastructure spending</li>
        <li>Buy bonds</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="text"><strong>Contractionary:</strong></div>
      <ul class="text">
        <li>Raise taxes</li>
        <li>Reduced government spending</li>
        <li>Sell bonds</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="subsection">Monetary Policy</div>
      <div class="text">Monetary policy is executed by the central bank by controlling the money supply and interest rates. The central bank is not tied to the government and is instead its (often) own entity. In the U.S, the central bank is the Federal Reserve, or the “Fed.” The central bank is the only place where the country’s currency can be legally printed or shredded.</div>

      <div class="text">How does the Fed impact the economy through interest rates?</div>
      <ol class="text">
        <li>Banks loan money to the public through the market for loanable funds – and in this market, the price is the interest rate (the percentage cut the banks take and that you pay extra for the loan).</li>
        <li>Banks must hold certain amounts of cash at periodic check-ins by the Fed (reserve requirement)
          <ul>
            <li>If they cannot meet requirement → must loan funds from Fed or other banks
              <ul>
                <li>Fed charges interest on this loan → the Federal Reserve Rate</li>
                <li>Banks adjust to rate to compete (preferred lender over Fed)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Impact: public’s ability to take loans and therefore their short-term purchasing power and the activity of the economy.</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="text"><strong>Expansionary:</strong></div>
      <ul class="text">
        <li>Lower interest rates</li>
        <li>Buy bonds</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="text"><strong>Contractionary:</strong></div>
      <ul class="text">
        <li>Raise interest rates</li>
        <li>Sell bonds</li>
      </ul>

            <td>Depends on the exact economic situation because certain policies make more sense for certain scenarios.</td>
            <td>
              Liquidity trap: monetary policy isn’t enough if people and businesses don’t borrow or spend even when money is cheap.<br>
              Inequality: lower impact on people without savings or credit access + low interest rates benefit wealthier individuals with appreciable assets.<br>
              Can’t target specific industries – only impacts the whole economy.
