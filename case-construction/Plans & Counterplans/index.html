        <h2>What is a plan in Parli?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A concrete set of actions or policies proposed by a team to solve the problem stated or implied by the motion.</li>
          <li>Usually ran by Gov, but Opp can run a plan as well, which would be called a counter-plan.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clarifies the debate by fixing the ground each side must cover.</li>
          <li>Focuses the clash on real-world mechanisms instead of abstract ideals.</li>
          <li>Frames which impacts matter most (cost, rights, effectiveness, etc.).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Building a Plan</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Pinpoint the degree of change you want to propose in reference to definitions/status quo:
            <ul>
              <li>Aim for something moderate to hard in your model — proposes real change without being extreme.</li>
              <li>Allows for a rich debate with nuanced arguments on both sides, while avoiding trite or one-sided clashes.</li>
              <li>Bigger changes are often more philosophically consistent and better match the scale of the problem to the scale of the solution.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            How to construct one?
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Easiest way:</strong> Steal someone else’s
                <ul>
                  <li>Since most debate topics reflect real-world issues, you could easily adapt one from a government, NGO, movement, group, etc.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Modify an existing model
                <ul>
                  <li>Strengthen or expand on a known model.</li>
                  <li>Be clear about the distinctions of your version.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Invent your own model
                <ul>
                  <li>Great for originality; opponents are less likely to anticipate them</li>
                  <li>Start by identifying the root problem, then propose a solution that:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Is realistic (based on how people and institutions actually behave)</li>
                      <li>Is practical (affordable, technologically feasible, logistically sound)</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Presenting & deploying your model:
            <ul>
              <li>First speaker should present model before giving arguments
                <ul>
                  <li>Intro (contextualization, burdens, etc.) → model → contentions</li>
                  <li>This helps frame the debate and which issues are most important.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Other Cases</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Status quo
            <ul>
              <li>Gov should never run SQ unless compelled to by the topic. (Then it’s likely a bad resolution.)</li>
              <li>Opp teams can run SQ, but be cautious:
                <ul>
                  <li>Pros: If unprepared, you can piggyback on Gov’s contextualization and explanation of the current system.</li>
                  <li>Cons: You risk being exposed for a shallow understanding or failing to effectively rebut alleged “harms” of the SQ (which may also be exaggerated or incorrect).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Opp counterplan
            <ul>
              <li>Pros: Will negate much of Gov’s preempted criticisms of the status quo.</li>
              <li>Cons: Admitting the SQ is broken weakens your ability to claim the Aff model is implausible, especially if your model is novel as well.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other tips for using/challenging models</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Models don’t win debates alone!
            <ul>
              <li>They structure the conversation, but need analysis to prove why the model works and why its benefits outweigh its harms or costs.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Don’t fixate on the monetary cost of a model; what matters is whether the benefits are worth the price, and if the cost is plausibly bearable.</li>
          <li>A good way to attack a model: challenge the assumptions made when the team constructed it
            <ul>
              <li>e.g., Did they realistically assess how individuals and groups behave in society? Is it really the role of the government (or other organisation) to do what is being proposed?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>It’s okay for opposing teams to concede some benefits of a model, as long as they prove why its harms outweigh its benefits.</li>
          <li>Plausibility debate – Don’t rely too much on arguing that “the Aff model would never happen.”
            <ul>
              <li>Unless the model is truly insane, judges will assume viability for the sake of debate, so engage with it directly.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example model: THS safe heroin injecting rooms</h2>
        <p>This motion allows for a range of plausible models depending on the implementation of the policy, which will significantly affect the debate. Here are some examples Gov might consider:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Model of government supplied heroin</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Mechanism: government provides heroin directly to registered users within designated safe injecting facilities</li>
              <li>Criticisms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Turns the government into a drug dealer – public backlash, ethical concerns</li>
                  <li>Raises questions about how long the government can afford to maintain such a system (especially if the number of users grow as a result)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Benefits:
                <ul>
                  <li>Effectively puts many drug dealers out of business</li>
                  <li>Reduces overdose deaths by ensuring supply is not contaminated or laced with dangerous substances</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Model of user supplied system</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Mechanism: Users bring their own heroin, and the facility allows use without questioning the source provided that use occurs within the safe injecting rooms</li>
              <li>Criticisms:
                <ul>
                  <li>Less control over drug purity and extent of undermining black market – limits the model’s ability to reduce overdoses and deaths</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Benefits:
                <ul>
                  <li>Avoids ethical and financial concerns of direct governmental provision</li>
                  <li>Still offers medical supervision, overdose prevention, support services, etc.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
