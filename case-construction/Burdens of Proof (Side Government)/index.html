      <div class="text">
        <p><strong>1. Define the Terms of the Resolution</strong><br>
        Definitions can be interpretive or dictionary definitions. If your opponent tries to define something differently, you can argue that your definition is “better.” This step is especially important in metaphorical or abstract resolutions.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Present a Clear Model or Interpretation</strong><br>
        Your model explains what would actually happen in the world if the resolution is enacted. Models are important because your opponent will often present disadvantages of the resolution that only apply under a certain model. If you can prove your model avoids those harms, you can avoid the clash altogether.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Prove the Resolution is “Generally True”</strong><br>
        You need to present a strong enough case to show that the resolution is true in a majority of cases or as a general principle. You don’t need to prove that the resolution is always true or in every circumstance. The burden is not absolute truth – it is general truth. This burden will be extremely important to the judge when evaluating clash and weighing.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Prove that Enacting the Resolution Will Do More Good Than Harm</strong><br>
        You must prove that the benefits of the resolution outweigh the harms. This will require a cost-benefit analysis that compares your advantages to their disadvantages. You must prove that even if some bad things happen under your model, the net benefit is still worth it.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Prove that the Status Quo is Inadequate</strong><br>
        You need to prove that the way things are right now is not working. This means identifying clear harms or inefficiencies in the status quo and showing that they are significant. If the other team successfully proves that the status quo is already solving the problem, the judge may not see a reason for change.</p>

        <p><strong>6. Prove that the Resolution is the Best Solution</strong><br>
        It is not enough to prove that the resolution is “a” solution. You must prove that it is “the best” available solution to the problem. That means comparing your proposal to other alternatives and showing that yours is more effective, more feasible, or has fewer unintended consequences.</p>

        <p><strong>7. Prove that the Resolution is Worth Implementing Despite Harms</strong><br>
        Your case must still be worth enacting even if the opponent proves that some harms would result. This goes back to the cost-benefit analysis: the resolution should still pass even in a world where the harms are real – as long as the benefits are greater.</p>
