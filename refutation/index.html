  <hr style="border: none; height: 2px; background-color: #352f5d;">
    <div class="text">	In debate, you will be required to respond to the various other arguments presented within rounds. And despite case construction being the essential backbone of any argumentation presented, refutation and rebuttal are what bring on the argumentative “back-and-forth” nature of a debate. However, as outlined by the NSDA (National Speech & Debate Association), speakers need to aim to: identify and discuss the biggest questions and clashes in the debate, rebut the most crucial points, and contribute original refutation to have a productive round.

    <div class="text">Refuting Assertions</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Assertion comes and goes in many different styles in debate, with the most common one being that in the case where an opponent has failed to prove something they claimed, you would be the one to point that out
</li>
        <li>“They have yet to provide us with any mechanism as to how x would lead to y”
</li>
      </ul>
    <div class="text">Counterexample</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Oftentimes, counters come in the form of facts or statistics that directly support the opposite of whatever your opponent has been trying to prove
</li>
        <li>This is most commonly the case in many political debates, policy debates, or otherwise debates that require a lot of background knowledge and research
</li>
        <li>E.g., “Due to this policy, we have actually seen a decrease in the amount of [positive benefits] that your side has claimed would result”
</li>
      </ul>
    <div class="text">Even-if responses</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Even-if responses are a last resort and should always come at the end of other rebuttals. They concede to an argument's logic but aim to prove how  that logical reasoning is instead beneficial to your case.
          
          Flipping is when you concede to an argument's logic but show why that logical reasoning is instead beneficial to your case.
</li>
        <li>This can come in mostly two forms: flipping the argument or mitigating its impact. 
          For example, flipping would sound like “Using their own logic/explanation, it actually supports our side of the house…” Mitigation would sound like "Even if our responses didn't stand, the impact of their argument would be minimal at best."
