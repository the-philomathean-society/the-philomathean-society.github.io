  <hr style="border: none; height: 2px; background-color: #352f5d;">
    <div class="text">	In debate, you will be required to respond to the various other arguments presented within rounds. And despite case construction being the essential backbone of any argumentation presented, refutation and rebuttal are what bring on the argumentative “back-and-forth” nature of a debate. However, as outlined by the NSDA (National Speech & Debate Association), speakers need to aim to: identify and discuss the biggest questions and clashes in the debate, rebut the most crucial points, and contribute original refutation to have a productive round.

                <li>Create new rebuttals
</li>
                <li>Structurally organize rebuttals (i.e., signposting, offering the comparative mechanization and impact)

                <li>Use the established framework to your advantage when it comes to weighing the debate/worlds 
</li>

There are some pieces of rebuttal that are far more important in round, and therefore, will require more time to analyze whereas some contentions may only require a line or two of actual rebuttal)

    <div class="subsection">Common Techniques of Refutation</div>
    <div class="text">Assertion</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Assertion comes and goes in many different styles in debate, with the most common one being that in the case where an opponent has failed to prove something they claimed, you would be the one to point that out
</li>
        <li>“They have yet to provide us with any mechanism as to how x would equal to y”
</li>
      </ul>
    <div class="text">Dissection</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Shedding proper light upon unstable reasoning, conditional contentions, logic gaps, inconsistent and incohesive argumentation, and even contradictions 
</li>
      </ul>
    <div class="text">Counter</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Oftentimes, counters come in the form of facts or statistics that directly support the opposite of whatever your opponent has been trying to prove
</li>
        <li>This is most commonly the case in many political debates, policy debates, or otherwise debates that require a lot of background knowledge and research
</li>
        <li>E.g., “Due to this policy, we have actually seen a decrease in the amount of [positive benefits] that your side has claimed would result”
</li>
      </ul>
    <div class="text">Minimizing Impact</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Perhaps one of the heaviest criteria for judges when it comes to actually considering the holistic round itself in debate, would be the impacts that both teams have presented, and what the audience is actually left with
</li>
        <li>Therefore, among the most effective strategies that you will often hear debaters using is impact minimization, where the main goal is to try and make your opponent’s impacts as weak as possible, or otherwise put them in a context where they do not end up mattering at all
</li>
        <li>The most common one you might hear is “perhaps in the short-term, x might impact y, but in the long-term, z remains a bigger societal issue”
</li>
      </ul>
    <div class="text">Turns</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Turns are a philosophical technique used by many famous speakers well-versed in the art of rhetoric, wherein one accepts a contention and then reverses the conclusion
</li>
        <li>Most debaters don’t even realize they are commonly using turns as a refutation technique while they are speaking
</li>
        <li>For example, “Using their own logic/explanation, it actually supports our side of the house…” or “Even if their harms still exists, here’s why our solution is more effective”
</li>
      </ul>
    <div class="text">Re-establishment of Definitions/Model</div>
      <ul>
        <li>Note that in most cases, a challenge to the definition or model is unnecessary and tends to waste precious speaking time, however, in some the cases where definitions, frameworks, or models have been set to be too heavily one-sided, one may raise a point of inquiry or clarification in order to challenge the established debate
