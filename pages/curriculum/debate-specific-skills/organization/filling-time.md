# Filling Time

The best way to fill time is through anecdotes and real life examples. But if you plan your speech well enough you won’t need to fill time. Rebutting, reconstructing, and constructing should take up the whole time. 

However, if you need to fill time try not to make it obvious. Put an anecdote in at the end to drive your side’s position home. Also, if you have a closing that is similar to your introduction that could take up time as well. 

For instance, “It is for these reasons Mr. Speaker that Side Oppositions points do not stand and Side Government remains in full support of the resolution (such and such)”. Filling time is something we will work on more especially when we start running rounds with unabridged time. Most of you didn’t even speak for your whole time which is only half of the time you normally need to speak for in a real debate.
