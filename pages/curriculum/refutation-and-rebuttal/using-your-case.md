# Using Your Case to Refute and Rebut

Oftentimes, arguments in your own case can be used to attack your opponent's. Constructing a solid case of your own will save you a lot of time during your refutation.

Identify points of similarity between both cases; pointing out similarities before going onto explaining why your reasoning is correct enables you to “hijack” their point and flip it to yours, and seem like you understand your opponents’ case better than they do.
