# Collegiate Parliamentary Debate Rounds

Anyone can take a look at these, as they’re honestly really fun to watch. However, some of the points they bring up and some of the takeaways are best appreciated at the higher levels of debate. Advanced candidates / debaters will definitely take more out of these than novices.

These videos are best for a few things, and pretty terrible in terms of others.

Good things:

* They offer clear insight into solid point construction, how to clash around a specific aspect of framing / a specific point (e.g. principled vs. pragmatic on how to frame / weigh debate).
* They provide examples of how to introduce originally (skipping formalities like the classic Mr. Speaker, Honorable Opponents, etc.) and with style, while still setting up useful framing for the debate
* They provide you with examples of excellent speakers in terms of rhetoric, as everyone in this league is skilled enough to speak off the top of their head without stumbling over every other word.
* They talk fast enough to practice flowing quickly.
* They take POIs at proper times (after rebuttal, not in the middle of a thought or sentence) and dismiss those that they think would hurt their speech / case

Bad things:

* They do NOT provide good examples of extensive / exhaustive rebuttal, as many times they try to dispel the opponents’ arguments on the highest level (in a clear clash of main points / cruxes)-- which is something that can be useful in your rounds, but takes a considerable amount of skill and many judges may take points for you not clearly disproving their points in turn.
* They do NOT provide examples of PM’s final speech, and do NOT provide good examples of speech structure for the other members either, as their league uses a different format. There are opening / closing teams for both side, and so I would suggest just watching the opening half.
