# Refutation and Rebuttal

Because debate is inherently adversarial, one core component of the activity is proving or trying to prove that your opponent's arguments are not valid. There is a difference between **refutation** and **rebuttal**: put simply, to **refute** an argument is to produce evidence to *prove* it untrue, while to **rebut** an argument is to *try to prove* it is untrue by offering a different point of view.
